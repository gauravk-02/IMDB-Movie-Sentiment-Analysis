# IMDB Movie Sentiment Analysis

## Project Description

The objective of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis model for IMDB movie reviews. This model, developed using Python, will classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. The project involves using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to extract meaningful features from textual data and classify them into positive or negative sentiments.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Collection**
   - Collect data from the IMDB dataset, which contains movie reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels (positive/negative).
   - Extract only the reviews and sentiment labels.

2. **Data Pre-processing**
   - Remove stop words, perform stemming, and convert all text to lowercase.
   - Tokenize reviews into words and convert tokens into numerical features using techniques such as bag-of-words or TF-IDF.

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - Extract features from the pre-processed data using techniques like word embeddings, n-grams, and topic modeling to derive meaningful features from the textual data.

4. **Model Selection and Training**
   - Select and train an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the sentiment analysis task.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Tools and Technologies Used

1. Python programming language
2. Jupyter Notebook or Spyder IDE
3. NLP libraries: NLTK, Spacy, Gensim
4. Machine Learning libraries: Scikit-Learn, Keras, TensorFlow
5. IMDB movie review dataset

## Expected Outcome

The expected outcome is a robust sentiment analysis model capable of accurately classifying movie reviews as positive or negative with high accuracy. This will allow users to quickly gain insights into the sentiment of a movie without needing to read through numerous reviews.
